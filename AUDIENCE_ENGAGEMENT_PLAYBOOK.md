- 📈 Technical debt that kept you awake
- 👥 New developers taking weeks to contribute
- 🐛 Tests that break when you look at them wrong
- 🔥 Deployments that make you pray

**Slide 8 - Discovery Moment**: "Who here has had an 'aha moment' with a framework?"
- Show of hands
- Quick 30-second story sharing
- Build anticipation for NestJS revelation

**Slide 15 - Live Demo Prediction**: "What do you think happens when we add this decorator?"
- Multiple choice on screen
- Audience votes with hands
- Reveal answer with live demo

### Post-Demo Validation

**Slide 20 - Confidence Check**: "How confident would you feel using NestJS after seeing this?"
- Very confident (green)
- Somewhat confident (yellow)
- Need more info (orange)
- Still skeptical (red)

## 🎭 Storytelling Moments

### Opening Hook (Slide 1-2)
**"The $2M Rewrite Story"**
> "Last year, I consulted with a startup that spent $2 million rewriting their Node.js API because it became unmaintainable. The founder looked at me and said, 'I wish someone had shown me NestJS three years ago.' Today, I'm showing it to you."

### Pain Point Amplification (Slide 5)
**"The 3 AM Deployment"**
> "Picture this: It's 3 AM, you're deploying a critical fix, and you realize changing one endpoint broke three others. Your phone starts buzzing with angry customer emails. We've all been there. But what if I told you this could be your last 3 AM deployment nightmare?"

### Transformation Moment (Slide 12)
**"The Junior Developer Test"**
> "Here's my favorite NestJS test: Can a junior developer understand your codebase in their first week? With Express, the answer is usually 'maybe in a month.' With NestJS, I've seen juniors contributing meaningful code on day three."

### Success Story (Slide 17)
**"The Unicorn Startup"**
> "One of my clients went from 3 developers to 30 in 18 months using NestJS. Their CTO told me, 'NestJS didn't just scale our code, it scaled our team.' That's the power of good architecture."

## 🎮 Interactive Exercises

### Exercise 1: Architecture Detective (Slide 6)
**Setup**: Show messy Express.js code
**Challenge**: "Spot the problems in 30 seconds"
**Audience Action**: Call out issues they see
**Payoff**: Reveal how NestJS solves each one

### Exercise 2: Decorator Prediction (Slide 11)
**Setup**: Show controller without decorators
**Challenge**: "What decorators would you add?"
**Audience Action**: Suggest decorators
**Payoff**: Live code the suggestions

### Exercise 3: Module Design (Slide 13)
**Setup**: Present a new feature requirement
**Challenge**: "How would you structure this module?"
**Audience Action**: Discuss with neighbors (2 minutes)
**Payoff**: Show NestJS best practice solution
