# Workshop

Purpose: minimal, stage-oriented shallow copy of the API code we will modify live. Keep files focused and small.

Structure

- 01-current: snapshot of current files we will touch
- 02-enhanced: scaffolds pre-created for guards/interceptors/pipes/decorators
- 03-product: stubs for queues/websockets to segue into productization
- 04-platform: stubs for multi-tenancy and microservice clients

Run: this folder is for presentation; not a runnable build. Use it for diffs and code walkthroughs.

## Important Notes

- Files use simplified import paths for demo clarity (e.g., `./users.service`)
- IDE errors for missing modules are expected and can be ignored
- Focus is on **code patterns and architecture**, not compilation
